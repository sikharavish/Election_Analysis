## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election aduit of a recent total congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1 Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary

- The winner of the election was:
    - Candidate (1,2 or 3), who received "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The project presents the opportunity to walk the shoes of the activities & effort carried out post-election emphasizing the time pressure. Hence, it is very important to automate tasks correctly and effectively that would help in reaching to conclusions early. The election audit takes into account the list of votes received from multiple sources (3 in this case) and the Candidate Name against whom the vote is casted and from which county.\n
  The direction was set through the milestones that need to be accomplished as mentioned in the project overview.\n
  To accomplish the goal the pre-work is critical which includes cleaning the data to be in similar format so that the program can read the excel file and provide the comprehensive output. If not, all the effort of this program would go in-vain. The main points that could be listed as learning points are:
  1. Cleaning up of Data & Organizing it
  2. Build the program to match the outcome/ expectation
  3. Ability to store the outcome in files for review \n

## Challenge Summary
The election audit is completed and the results are in a file for authorized members to view. The goal has been accomplished which ensures the list of candidates is displayed with the votes they received. And, identifying the winning candidate.
